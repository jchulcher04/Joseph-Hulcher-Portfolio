    Reading the test results
The unit tests tell what they are testing, and how many T's (for succesful test cases) should appear
No bugs found currently remain, but problems with seting and such were found in unit testing
At the end of every Test file there is /*  and then the expected output

./interpreter.exe tests/booleanOperations.lisp
    this tests if cond = < > and? or?
